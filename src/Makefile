# Compile the `emitted.s` file that's generated by the tests together with the
# `runtime.c` into an executable.
#
# -m32 forces to compile for 32bit target, this prevents accidental surprises.
#
# `-g3 -ggdb3` generates as much debug symbols as possible, notably the latter
# allows the use of macros in gdb prompt. As of now, only GCC seems to support
# this option.
#
# Omitting the frame pointer with `-fomit-frame-pointer` removes the standard
# function preamble and post when not needed. This makes the assembly slightly
# easier to read and harder to debug.
#
# `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables` gets rid of all the '.cfi' directives from
# the generated asm.
